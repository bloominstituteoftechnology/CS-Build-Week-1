# This file will be run to auto-correct certain swiftlint rules before swiftlint is run with the standard .swiftlint.yml configuration file.
#
# An enhancement to do this has been requested here: https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/issues/1451
# Once done, that enhancement might obsolete this approach.

# Only add rules here you want to auto-correct
whitelist_rules:
- trailing_whitespace
- trailing_semicolon
- trailing_newline
excluded: # paths to ignore during linting.
  - Carthage
